# Simulate the Mac Keyboard on a Windows Keyboard


AutoHotkey Mappings to simulate OSX keyboard behaviour on Windows

This basically means remapping many of the hotkey combinations that use the Windows-Key (Meta-Modifier) and the ALT modifier key.


For this to work you must [disable Windows Logout Hokey](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/disableenable-lock-workstation-functionality-windows-l/) `WIN + L`

Also the `Win + X`  [Hotkeys need to get disabled](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/disable-winx-shortcut-keys-on-windows-vista/)


## Installation

+ Install Autohotkey
+ Run `MacSimulate.ahk`
+ Optional: make a link and put it in autostart
